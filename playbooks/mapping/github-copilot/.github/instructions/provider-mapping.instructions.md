# Provider Mapping

- Read `.github/console-fields.ground-truth.json` before mapping.
- Ask for exact provider dashboard labels, helper text, placeholders, section headings, selected provider type, and setup steps.
- Ask whether the provider is creating a client, application, API key, token, secret, or connector.
- Validate with `https://docs.caracal.run` and official provider docs.
- Map provider terminology only to visible Caracal Console provider fields.
- Keep provider credentials off resource fields.
- Never reveal raw secrets.
- Ask for more labels, screenshots, or helper text when evidence is incomplete instead of guessing.
- Do not generate sample provider configs unless the user explicitly asks for examples.

Output one mapping block per field:
