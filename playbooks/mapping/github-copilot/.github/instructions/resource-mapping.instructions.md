# Resource Mapping

- Read `.github/console-fields.ground-truth.json` before mapping.
- Ask for exact Console labels, helper text, placeholders, selected provider, upstream target, and scopes.
- Validate with `https://docs.caracal.run`.
- Map only to visible resource fields.
- Keep routing and target values on the resource.
- Keep upstream credential values on the provider.
- Explain provider/resource overlap only when needed to fill the form correctly.
- Ask for more evidence when required labels or docs are missing instead of guessing.
- Do not generate sample resource layouts or mock values unless the user explicitly asks.

Use the standard field mapping format from `AGENTS.md`.
