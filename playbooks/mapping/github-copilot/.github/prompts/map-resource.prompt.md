# Map Resource

Map the resource form fields to Caracal Console resource fields.

Steps:

1. Read `.github/console-fields.ground-truth.json`.
2. Ask for missing labels, helper text, placeholders, selected provider, scopes, and upstream target.
3. Validate with Caracal docs.
4. Keep resource values separate from provider credential values.
5. Ask for more evidence when labels or docs are incomplete instead of guessing.
6. Return the standard field mapping format.

Do not generate sample resource values unless the user explicitly asks.
