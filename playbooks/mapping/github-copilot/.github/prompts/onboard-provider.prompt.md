# Onboard Provider

Help the user prepare provider-side setup before filling Caracal Console.

Steps:

1. Ask which provider and auth flow they need.
2. Ask whether they are creating a client, application, API key, token, secret, or connector.
3. Read `.github/console-fields.ground-truth.json`.
4. Check provider docs and Caracal docs.
5. Tell the user which visible Caracal Console field receives each provider value.

Never ask for raw secrets in chat.
Do not invent onboarding steps that are not supported by the docs or visible Console fields.
