# Validate Configuration

Review the completed setup.

Steps:

1. Mask any raw secrets before analysis.
2. Read `.github/console-fields.ground-truth.json`.
3. Check each value against visible Console fields.
4. Validate field behavior with Caracal docs and provider docs.
5. Report missing, unsupported, misplaced, ambiguous, or unverified values.

Keep the review short and field-focused.
Warn the user when credentials were detected and continue with masked values only.
