# Safe Secret Handling

## Procedure

1. Detect sensitive values before repeating user input.
2. Replace raw values with safe masks such as `<api_key: masked abc...xyz>`.
3. Do not ask the user to paste full secrets again.
4. Warn the user that credentials were detected and recommend redaction before future sharing.
5. Continue mapping using masked values or environment variable names.

Treat all provider credentials as secrets.
